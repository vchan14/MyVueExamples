# MyVueExamples

This project is a collection of Vue3 Repl examples. Most of the examples 
are inspired by [svelete.dev/examples](https://svelte.dev/examples/hello-world) and
the [VueJS documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

## Why?
I love Vue3 documentation, but sometimes I just want to figure out how to do X or Y quickly. These examples serve as 
a quick reference (cheatsheet) that allows us to do it. Moreover, it gives an overview of the essential features of 
Vue3.

## How to use it? 
The examples are hosted at - https://vue3examples.netlify.app/HelloWorld

You can customize this project for your own uses. To add new examples: 
1. Go to `src/views/[category]` and add a Vue file to it.
2. If your example contains multiple Vue files, create a new folder and add them to it. 
3. Name your example vue files and folders in a PascalCase format. e.g: `HelloWorld.vue`, `src/views/styles/ScopedStyles/ScopedStyles.vue`, `src/views/styles/ScopedStyles/ScopedStylesChild.vue`.
4. The examples will be automatically added to the sidebar.
