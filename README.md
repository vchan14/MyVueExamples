# MyVueExamples

This project is a collection of Vue3 composition API examples. Most of the examples

the [VueJS documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).


The idea is to have a small and simple example of fundamental Vue3 concepts that we
can look up quickly as a cheat sheet and be able to interact with them through a Repl.
